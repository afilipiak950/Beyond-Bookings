# KI Pricing Agent - Replit Documentation

## Overview
KI Pricing Agent, rebranded as "bebo convert", is a production-ready SaaS web application designed for hotel pricing intelligence and document analysis. Its core purpose is to provide AI-powered pricing calculations, hotel data scraping, customer management, and comprehensive reporting. The platform has evolved to include advanced document analysis capabilities, allowing users to upload and process various file types (PDFs, images, Excel) for automated OCR and data extraction using Mistral AI. It also features a multi-step workflow for pricing calculations, financial analysis, and PowerPoint presentation generation.
